# Agent Rules

## Formatting

- **Avoid markdown tables in summaries** – Dark themes make table content difficult to read. Use lists or prose instead.
- **Use lowercase for comments** – For comments use lowercase, except for acronyms.

## File Updates

- **Date Updates** – Check for a date in the first 20 rows of any file being updated; if found, update it to the current date.
